# Training
If you need to test that training is working you can perform the following

- mock_pretrain
_ mock_finetune

## mock pretrain
this will perform a pretrain against some random generated data.
this will not do any useful training but show that the training code works.

```bash
python tools/train/mock_pretrain_train.py
```

## mock finetune
this will perform a pretrain against some random generated data.
this will not do any useful training but show that the training code works.

```bash
python tools/train/mock_finetune_train.py
```
